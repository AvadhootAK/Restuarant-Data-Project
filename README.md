# Food Delivery Analytics – Zomato Case Study

##  Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end **data analytics case study** focused on understanding restaurant performance and customer behavior on a food delivery platform (Zomato).
The goal is to identify **what drives customer satisfaction**, **where restaurants struggle**, and **how data can support better business decisions**.

---

##  Objectives

* Analyze restaurant performance across locations, cuisines, pricing, and ratings
* Study customer behavior related to delivery time, spending, and ratings
* Identify root causes behind low ratings and poor performance
* Provide actionable, business-friendly recommendations

---

##  Datasets Used

* **Zomato Bangalore Restaurant Dataset** (Kaggle – real-world data)
* **Synthetic Customer Orders Dataset** (created to simulate real order behavior)

> Note: Large raw datasets are not included in this repository due to GitHub size limits.

##  Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Key Analysis Performed

### 1 Restaurant-Level Analysis

* Ratings, votes, pricing distribution
* Cost vs rating (expectation mismatch)
* Location-wise and cuisine-wise performance
* Weighted scoring to evaluate restaurants beyond raw ratings

### 2 Customer Behavior Analysis

* Delivery time vs customer ratings
* Spend buckets vs rating distribution
* Order patterns and customer satisfaction trends

### 3 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

* Impact of pricing on ratings
* Competition pressure by location
* Demand vs competition analysis
* Identification of high-risk and high-opportunity zones

---

##  Key Insights

* Higher prices do not always lead to higher ratings
* Customers value **consistency and value for money** more than premium pricing
* Locations with high demand but low competition perform best
* Overcrowded areas dilute customer attention and increase execution pressure
* Simpler menus and operational focus improve customer satisfaction

---

##  Business Recommendations

* Align pricing with actual customer experience
* Avoid highly saturated locations for expansion
* Focus on quality and consistency in competitive areas
* Reduce menu complexity to improve execution
* Use data-driven insights for location and pricing decisions
